# 🧠 Angular Forms - The Friendly Guide

## 👋 Introduction

In Angular, there are **two main ways to build forms**:

- **Template-Driven Forms** – Great for simpler forms. Most of the form logic is written directly in the HTML using Angular directives.
- **Reactive Forms** – Better for complex forms. You define the form structure and validation in TypeScript, giving you more flexibility and control.

## 🆚 Template-Driven vs Reactive Forms

| Feature              | Template-Driven           | Reactive                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Code Location        | Mostly in HTML             | Mostly in TypeScript             |
| Setup                | Simple to set up           | More structured and scalable     |
| Use Case             | Basic forms                | Advanced, dynamic forms          |
| Validation           | Written in the template    | Written in the component code    |

Template-driven forms are easier for beginners and good for basic use cases. Reactive forms are more robust and better suited for when you need advanced logic, dynamic controls, or custom validations.

## ✅ Form Validation

Angular provides tools to help us make sure users fill out forms correctly. These are called **validators**.

### Built-in Validators

- `required`: Makes sure the field is not left empty.
- `email`: Checks if the text is a valid email address.
- `minlength` / `maxlength`: Controls the number of characters allowed.
- `pattern`: Uses regular expressions to match specific input patterns.

### Custom Validators

You can also write your own validators if the built-in ones aren’t enough. These are especially useful in Reactive Forms, where they are easier to manage and reuse.

## 🔍 Understanding an Input Field

A typical Angular form input includes attributes like:

- `name`: Identifies the field in the form.
- `ngModel`: Connects the input to Angular's form control system.
- `required`: Makes the input mandatory.
- `minlength`: Sets a minimum number of characters.
- `placeholder`: Shows hint text inside the field.
- `#input="ngModel"`: Creates a reference to check if the field is valid, touched, etc.

These attributes let Angular track the state of the input — whether it’s valid, touched, or has any errors.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Always give your inputs a `name` when using `ngModel`.
- Use `#inputName="ngModel"` in the template to check things like `valid`, `touched`, or `errors`.
- Make sure to import `FormsModule` (for template-driven forms) or `ReactiveFormsModule` (for reactive forms) in your module to make everything work.
